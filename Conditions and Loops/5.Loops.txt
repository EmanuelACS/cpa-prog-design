#Excercise
Write an if statement that checks that value of secondNumber.
 If secondNumber is 0, display variable divideByZeroError.
 Otherwise, calculate result as firstNumber divided by
 secondNumber then output result.  


Variable Declarations
    num firstNumber = 0, secondNumber = 0, result = 0
    string numberMsg = "Enter number "
    string divideByZeroError = "Cannot divide by 0" 

output numberMsg
input firstNumber
output numberMsg
input secondNumber

if secondNumber = 0
    output divideByZeroError
else 
    result = firstNumber / secondNumber
    output result
end if

#Nested Ifs
The business rules for the pseudocode below are as follows:
-	if the customer has 10 or less items in their shopping cart, the shipping is a minimum of $20.
    - If 10 or less items and the order subtotal is 100 or less, an additional $5 shipping fees applies.
-	if the customer has more than 10 items in their shopping cart, the shipping is free.
    - If over 10 items and the order subtotal is over 100, then an 11% discount applies.

Variable declarations
   num nbrOfItemsInCart = 0, shippingCost = 0
   num orderSubtotal = 0, discount = 0, subtotalThreshold = 100
   num discountForBigOrders = 0.11, additionalShippingFee = 5
   num nbrItemsForFreeShipping = 10, baseShippingCost = 20

#pseudocode here to retrieve nbrOfItemsInCart and orderSubtotal
    #from web server

if nbrOfItemsInCart <= nbrItemsForFreeShipping
   shippingCost = baseShippingCost
   if orderSubtotal <= subtotalThreshold
      shippingCost = shippingCost + additionalShippingFee
   end if
else
   shippingCost = 0
   if orderSubtotal > subtotalThreshold
      discount = discountForBigOrders
   end if
end if

total = orderSubtotal + shippingCost â€“ (orderSubtotal * discount)
