 The program calculates a 25% sales fee and 13% tax.
 The output should read:

    Before tax cost: xxx. Final cost: yyy

 where xxx is the cost before tax and yyy is the final cost.

Variable Declarations

   num costPrompt = "Enter base cost of car: "

   num salesPercent = 0.25, taxRate = 0.13

   num baseCost = 0, costBeforeTax = 0, finalCost = 0

   string beforeTaxMsg = "Before tax cost: "

   string finalMsg = ". Final cost: "

input baseCost

costBeforeTax = baseCost + (baseCost * salesPercent)

finaCost = costBeforeTax + (costBeforeTax * taxRate)
